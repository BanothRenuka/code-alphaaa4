    <p class="subtitle">Basics of Technical Indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages)</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Technical analysis is a widely used trading approach that evaluates securities by analyzing
            statistics generated by market activity such as price and volume. This case study focuses
            on three popular technical indicators: Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average
            Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Moving Averages.
        </p>

        <h2>2. What Are Technical Indicators?</h2>
        <p>
            Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on historical price, volume,
            or open interest data. Traders use them to identify trends, momentum, and potential
            buy or sell signals. These indicators help traders make informed decisions rather than
            relying on emotions.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h2>
        <p>
            The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and
            change of price movements. RSI values range from 0 to 100.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>RSI above 70 indicates overbought conditions</li>
            <li>RSI below 30 indicates oversold conditions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Traders use RSI to identify potential reversals and trend strength.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Moving Averages</h2>
        <p>
            Moving averages smooth out price data to identify trends over a specific period.
            The two most common types are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple Moving Average (SMA)</li>
            <li>Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A bullish signal occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term
            moving average, known as a “Golden Cross”.
        </p>

        <h2>5. MACD Indicator</h2>
        <p>
            MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) shows the relationship between two
            moving averages of a security’s price.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>MACD Line</li>
            <li>Signal Line</li>
            <li>Histogram</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Traders look for crossovers and divergence to identify momentum changes.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Practical Application</h2>
        <p>
            Traders often combine RSI, MACD, and Moving Averages to improve accuracy.
            For example, RSI can identify overbought levels, while MACD confirms momentum,
            and moving averages confirm trend direction.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Technical indicators are powerful tools when used correctly. While they do not
            guarantee profits, they help traders reduce emotional decision-making and
            improve consistency. A disciplined approach and risk management are essential
            for successful trading.
